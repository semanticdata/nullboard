<h1><img src="extras/favicon-16.png" alt="icon" height="24px" /> Nullboard</h1>

Nullboard is a minimalist take on a kanban board / a task list manager, designed to be compact, readable, and quick in use. The name also happens to abbreviate to [NB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nota_bene), which I think is a nice touch.

## ‚ú® Features

### Dead Simple

* Single-page web app - just one HTML file, a jQuery package and, a webfont pack.
* Can be used completely offline. In fact, it's written exactly with this use in mind.

### Locally Stored

* All data is stored locally, for now using [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
* The data can be exported to- or imported from a plain text file in a simple JSON format.
* The data can also be automatically backed up to a local disk with the help of:
  * [Nullboard Agent](https://nullboard.io/backups) - a native Windows app
  * [Nullboard Agent Express Port](https://github.com/justinpchang/nullboard-agent-express) - an express.js-based portable app
  * [nbagent](https://github.com/luismedel/nbagent) - a version for Unix systems, in Python

### UI & UX

The whole thing is largely about making it convenient to use. Everything is editable in place, all changes are saved automatically and the last 50 revisions are kept for undo/redo:

New notes can be quickly added directly where they are needed, e.g. before or after existing notes:

![Ctrl-add note](images/nullboard-ctrl-add-note.gif)

Notes can also be dragged around, including to and from other lists:

![Drag-n-drop](images/nullboard-drag-n-drop.gif)

Lists can be moved around as well, though not as flashy as notes:

![List swapping](images/nullboard-list-swap.gif)

Nearly all controls are hidden by default to reduce visual clutter to its minimum:

![Hidden controls](images/nullboard-hidden-controls.gif)

Longer notes can be collapsed to show just the first line, for even more compact view of the board:

![Collapsed notes](images/nullboard-collapsed-notes.gif)

Notes can also be set to look different. This can be used to partitioning lists into sections:

Links starting with `https://` and `http://` are recognized. They will "pulse" on mouse hover and can be opened via the right-click menu.

Pressing CapsLock will highlight all links and make them left-clickable.

The default font is [Barlow](https://tribby.com/fonts/barlow/) - it's both narrow *and* still very legible. Absolutely fantastic design!

The font can be changed; its size and line height can be adjusted:

The color theme can be inverted:

Also features:

* Support for multiple boards with near-instant switching.
* Undo/redo for the last 50 revisions per board (configurable in the code).
* Keyboard shortcuts, including Tab'ing through notes.

### Caveats

* Written for desktop and keyboard/mouse use.
* Essentially untested on mobile devices and against tap/touch input.
* Works in Firefox, tested in Chrome, should work in Safari and may work in Edge (or what it's called now).
* Uses localStorage for storing boards/lists/notes, so be careful around [clearing your cache](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9948284/how-persistent-is-localstorage).
